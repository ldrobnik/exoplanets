## A few words about the project

The app provides a visual representation of the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) by means of the **Exoplanet Archive API**. The user can filter the exoplanets based on their radius, temperature and density. After clicking a planet, a modal with detailed information is displayed.
